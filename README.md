I basicly get the camera XY coords -> calibrate to realworld -> Writes a txt file with G-code -> Uses installed GRBL to send the code.
You need to setup GRBL first in a GRBL-sender, im using UGS.

Fist part of code is for user settings. Parts are commented so should be fairly straight forward.

useArduino == true starts the connection with the arduino/serialport. You need to know what port yours are using and change the line:
s = serial.Serial('COM3', 115200)
to the proper COM port.

send function is copy/pasted from another github file for sending gcode from a txtfile with GRBL.

Main part of the streaming code is in takepicture()
Code exits if there is no camera/webcam plugged in in any COM / USB

Calibration is done with a factor and in my case I did not want the robot to be able to move in all visable camera-area.
